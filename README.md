# Final Year Project Database System

Final Year Project Database System is a Web Application developed using Node.js for backend runtime engine and MySQL and Mongodb for database. There is no explicit frontend runtime as the whole HTML is rendered in the serverside and uses EJS to dynamically create pages. The webpages themselves use libraries like PICO for easy design. Authentication and session management is handled using Passport.js which is available as a node module (package) via npm, node.jsâ€™s package manager.

The project aims to act as a central archive for links to various project submitted by students of BCT at Pulchowk Campus as a part of their final year curriculum.
